# Current Development Status

This project is currently in development with some features not yet fully implemented. Important notes:

#### Development Notes

- **Authentication**: Currently using a hard-coded customer ID (1) for all operations. This ID corresponds to the admin user in the database.
- **Cart Management**: Currently, customer ID 1 (admin user) is used for all carts. In the final implementation, each customer will have one persistent cart that's initialized upon their first visit after registration. This cart remains associated with their account across sessions until items are purchased, at which point the cart items are converted to an order and the cart is cleared but retained for future use.
- **Admin Features**: Admin dashboard for managing books and orders is planned but not yet implemented.
- **Payment Processing**: Payment is simulated and no actual payment processing is implemented.

For a complete list of planned features, please see our [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) file.
